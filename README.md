<h1>GUI_Calculator_csharp</h1>

**Description:**
The "GUI_Calculator_csharp" project is a graphical user interface (GUI) calculator developed in C#. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator allows users to input numbers via the GUI buttons, perform operations, and view the results dynamically.

**Features:**
1. **User-Friendly Interface:** The calculator features a clean and intuitive user interface designed to enhance usability.
2. **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Users can perform common arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. **Clear Functionality:** The "Clear" button allows users to clear the input field, enabling them to start fresh calculations.
4. **Sign Change:** Users can toggle the sign of the displayed number between positive and negative.
5. **Percentage Calculation:** The calculator includes a function to calculate percentages of the input number.
6. **Error Handling:** The calculator includes error handling mechanisms to handle invalid inputs and prevent crashes.
7. **Visual Customization:** The form layout and button styles have been customized to enhance the visual appeal and user experience.

**How to Use:**
1. Run the application to launch the calculator interface.
2. Input numbers using the numerical buttons (0-9) or the decimal point button (,).
3. Perform arithmetic operations by clicking on the corresponding operation buttons (+, -, *, /).
4. Use the "Clear" button to clear the input field and start a new calculation.
5. Toggle the sign of the displayed number using the "+/-" button.
6. Calculate percentages by clicking on the "%" button.
7. Click on the "=" button to display the result of the operation.
8. The result will be displayed in the input field.
